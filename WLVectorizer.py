        Parameters
        ----------
        r : int 
            The maximal radius size.

        l : float
            The lambda weight factor.

        nbits : int 
            The number of bits that defines the feature space size: |feature space|=2^nbits.

        normalization : bool 
            If set the resulting feature vector will have unit euclidean norm.

    
            If 0 then treat all labels as strings. 

        discretization_dimension : int
            Size of the discretized label vector.
